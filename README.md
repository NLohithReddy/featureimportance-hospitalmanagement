## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze hospital timeliness data and build a machine learning model to predict timeliness ratings for hospitals. The project uses the XGBoost classifier to perform this task.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the analysis script, you will need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- xgboost

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib xgboost
